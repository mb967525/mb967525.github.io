This is my **first post**.

I have developed a lot of opinions of film through online criticism besides what I have on my own. One of my favorite things to do is watch trailers and read reviews on Metacritic in order to formulate these opinions. It has become such a useful tool in my film watching process, and I highly recommend looking up films before and/or after you watch them!
