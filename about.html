## About Me

Growing up with avid film watchers for parents, I was shown many movies that I would not have seen if not for their help. With this kind of upbringing, I inherited the movie-lover gene, and independently continued my film search. As I have grown up, I have been able to see more and more, and the more people I have asked about them.
 

## Why Classic Films?

For the most part, everyone around my age has never even heard of the movies that I have discussed. Most of them would not even consider watching a movie that was made prior to 1970. I find this to be genuinely upsetting because I have grown as a person through these films, and want everyone to be able to experience them like I have. Because of this, I have compiled a list of the most meaningful, unique, and relevant movies for my generation to watch.
