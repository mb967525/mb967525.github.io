 <p> 1. The Dirty Dozen (1967)
 
 <p> The story follows a group of convicted murderers who have been assigned to what is practically a suicide mission of a mass assassination of German officers during WWII. The men are gritty and ruthless, but their Major, Reisman, is determined that they can change. Although fictionalized, the story is just that much more compelling for its honorable soldiers and all the character development you could hope for. Since its release, it has been considered one the quintessential “guy’s movies”, but I find that there is no reason that anyone would not identify with the characters, or feel some sort of empathy towards them. The film features Hollywood greats like Lee Marvin and Charles Bronson, but made the careers of those like Jim Brown and Clint Walker. Most importantly, it shows that everyone deserves a second chance, and that you never truly know the issues that people are dealing with.

 <p> 2. Goodbye, Mr.Chips (1939)
   
 <p> Told as one big flashback, Goodbye, Mr. Chips tells the story of Mr. Chips, a headmaster at a boarding school that is looking back on his life and career. In the beginning he was strict and lonely, yet throughout the movie, the audience discovers why and how that has changed. He meets his one true love within the sequence and she teaches him not only how to love her and his students, but also himself. Mr. Chips quickly changes his outlook on life and he begins to learn the importance of dedication to everyone and everything in his life. The flashback dominates the movie, and because of this the film takes place over multiple decades, making it possible to see how much he has grown. Lead Robert Donat won for his role of Mr. Chips at the 1940 Academy Awards, and the film was nominated for six other awards.

 <p> 3. Shane (1953)
   
 <p> This film is about a family taking in a worn-out gunfighter in the old West. Shane has no place to go and accepts an offer to stay the night at a kind family’s ranch. His stay is extended when he learns that the family is under fire with a local villain. Shane tries his hardest to leave his past behind, but inevitably realizes what he needs to do. With growing feelings towards the wife and son of the family, he knows that important decisions need to be made and all the pressure is on him. One of the main themes of the movie is that violence is never the answer, except when it is. You feel so deeply about the characters and realize that although fictional, there is still good in humanity. The sacrifice that Shane makes in order for everyone else’s life to improve is truly honorable. Director George Stevens presents one of his best works with Shane, although he has close competition with hits like Giant and A Place in the Sun. The movie only went on to win the Academy Award for Best Cinematography that year, but is still considered to be one of the best American films ever made.

 <p> 4. In the Heat of the Night (1967)
   
 <p> While waiting for a train in Mississippi, Philadelphia Detective Virgil Tibbs played by Sidney Poitier is arrested and wrongly accused of murder. When Tibbs and Gillespie, the cop who arrested him, arrive back at the police station, Gillespie is embarrassed to find that Tibbs is one of the best homicide detectives in the country. Tibbs is then asked to help with the case in which he hesitantly accepts, as he is in a very racially hostile town. While investigating the murder is interesting, the underlying themes of the film including wrongful racial prejudice and working together are the reason that the movie is considered one of the best from the decade. The film went on to win five awards at the 1967 Academy Award Ceremony including Best Picture. Although some of the language and aspects of the story are dated, the themes are still very much prevalent today.

 <p> 5. Planet of the Apes (1968)
   
 <p> Set in the future, a group of astronauts crash-land on an unknown planet. While trying to discover where they are, they are suddenly imprisoned by intelligent, human-like apes. They quickly discover that this is their planet, and humans are treated like animals. The movie follows George, played by Charlton Heston, and his attempted escape from his imprisonment. Although it sounds silly today, the film was critically-acclaimed for its unique plot and mesmerizing cinematography. It has one of the most famous endings in a movie of all-time, and audiences are shocked in it’s reveal. The film discusses many different conflicts including man versus self, man versus man, and man versus society. There are aspects of destruction, humanity, and an overall loss of world-view. The Planet of the Apes won no awards during the award show season, and looking back now, film critics find it astounding. The film’s popularity led to many sequels and franchise spin-offs.

 <p> 6. Double Indemnity (1944)
   
 <p> This film begins with one of the last scenes of the story’s sequence. Walter Neff, played by Fred McMurray, confesses to the murder of his lover’s husband. The rest of the film is essentially a flashback showing how Neff got himself into the situation, and how he was able to commit the crime. In short, he is seduced by a lonely housewife while selling insurance, kills her husband for her, and his best friend is beginning to catch on with his actions. This film is probably the most entertaining on the list, showing that there is still a possibility for plot twists even when knowing the ending. The overall theme is that anyone can be blinded by passion, in this case leading to one of the worst possible outcomes. Although this is not much of a life lesson, it is a thrilling film that has no expiration date. While the film did not win anything at the Academy Awards in 1944, it still holds the spot for the 38th best film ever made from the American Film Institute.

 <p> 7. The Best Years of Our Lives (1946)
   
 <p> Directed by Samuel Goldwyn, this film is about three World War II veterans returning home to suburban America. They were unaware of how their families had changed, and were forced to integrate themselves back into daily life; a task proved harder than they thought it would be. With three leads, one struggling to keep a job and his marriage, another unable to adapt to new changes and people in the workplace, and the last unsure his fiance still loves him because of the loss of his hands in the war. The stories intertwine and act as a microcosm of the realities of the return of shell-shocked servicemen. The film is considered one of the greatest films ever made, and made a career for all of its leads. It presents a theme that is still relevant today, being that it is normal to fear life. The characters faced the unimaginable and had to return, trying their best to keep themselves together. It is an emotional, vulnerable film that is worthy of any and all praise. Samuel Goldwyn was famously quoted for saying, “I don’t care if this film doesn’t make a nickel. I just want every man, woman, and child in America to see it”.
