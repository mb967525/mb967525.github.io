 <p> 1. The Dirty Dozen (1967)
 
 <p> The story follows a group of convicted murderers who have been assigned to what is practically a suicide mission of a mass assassination of German officers during WWII. The men are gritty and ruthless, but their Major, Reisman, is determined that they can change. Although fictionalized, the story is just that much more compelling for its honorable soldiers and all the character development you could hope for. Since its release, it has been considered one the quintessential “guy’s movies”, but I find that there is no reason that anyone would not identify with the characters, or feel some sort of empathy towards them. The film features Hollywood greats like Lee Marvin and Charles Bronson, but made the careers of those like Jim Brown and Clint Walker. Most importantly, it shows that everyone deserves a second chance, and that you never truly know the issues that people are dealing with.
